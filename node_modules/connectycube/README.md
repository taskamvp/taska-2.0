## Connect SDK

Simply connect the JS file as a normal script (UMD):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/connectycube@x.x.x/dist/connectycube.min.js"></script>
```

where **x.x.x** is the desired JS SDK version (check for [Releases page](https://github.com/ConnectyCube/connectycube-js-sdk-releases/releases) for all available versions).

Then a window scoped variable called `ConnectyCube` is created.

Or install the package as node_module:

```bash
npm install connectycube --save
```

And add script to HTML file from the 'node_modules' folder (as a relative path):

```html
<script src="~/node_modules/connectycube/dist/connectycube.min.js"></script>
```

CommonJS:

```javascript
const ConnectyCube = require('connectycube');
```

ES modules:

```javascript
import ConnectyCube from 'connectycube';
```

## Initialize the ConnectyCube SDK

```javascript
const credentials = {
  appId: 21,
  authKey: 'A123210A-78AE-1DF9-9DD4-CC321AB6C189',
};

const config = {
  debug: { mode: 1 },
};

ConnectyCube.init(credentials, config);
```

You be able to create more then one client instance:

```javascript
const cubeSender = new ConnectyCube.ConnectyCube();
const cubeReceiver = new ConnectyCube.ConnectyCube();

cubeSender.init(credentials, config);
cubeReceiver.init(credentials, config);
```

See [an example of simple application based on Webpack build](https://github.com/ConnectyCube/connectycube-js-samples/tree/master/sample-webpack-build-app)

## SSR (Server-Side Rendering) Guide

When using ConnectyCube SDK in SSR environments (e.g., Next.js, Remix), some native Node.js modules like events may cause errors due to differences between Node and browser environments. Here are recommendations to ensure smooth SSR integration:

### Usage

```bash
# With npm
npm install connectycube
npx connectycube patch-ssr      # Apply SSR patches
# npx connectycube revert-ssr   # Revert SSR patches

# With yarn
yarn add connectycube
yarn connectycube patch-ssr     # Apply SSR patches
# yarn connectycube revert-ssr  # Revert SSR patches
```

This script applies fixes to make the SDK compatible with SSR environments.

## Supported platforms
